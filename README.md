<!--
**Deftunk/Deftunk** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on streamroot dashboard and apis
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning golang
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about React, Node.js, Golang, microservices stuff 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: it's on the left ğŸ‘ˆ
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Hey Deftunk !
